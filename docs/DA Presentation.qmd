# Introduction

- Replication is a key principle of scientific research
- It checks whether published findings are correct
- Without replication, errors can spread unchecked
- Important in economics due to policy implications

# What is a Replication Study?

- Repeating an original study's analysis
- Uses the same data and methods
- Purpose: verify results
- Tests transparency and reliability

# Why Replication Was Important

- Other researchers examined their calculations
- Replication efforts found:
  - Coding problems
  - Data exclusions
  - Spreadsheet errors
- Conclusions requiring revision



# Example of Replication for Accuracy

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Sample dataset
debt <- c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
growth <- c(5, 4, 3, 1, -1)

# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(debt, growth)

# Calculate correlation
cor(df$debt, df$growth)

```


# Why These Errors Matter

- Data mistakes influenced real-world decisions
- Replication prevented misleading conclusions



# Example of Replication in Error Detection

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Original Dataset
debt <- c(30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130)
growth <- c(4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1, 0.5)

df <- data.frame(debt, growth)
df

# The Researcher accidentally forgets to include one high-debt country
# ERROR: only first 5 rows used

wrong_avg <- mean(df$growth[1:5])
wrong_avg


# CORRECT calculation
correct_avg <- mean(df$growth)
correct_avg

```

# What Replication Teaches Us

- Even famous studies can have errors
- Transparency is essential
- Code and data must be shared
- Independent verification improves research

# Benefits of Replication Studies

- Detect mistakes
- Improve accuracy
- Increase trust
- Strengthen scientific credibility
- Support better policy decisions


# Conclusion

- Replication protects science from error
- Trust comes from verification, not reputation
- Replication makes research stronger
